We went through so much trouble to get him out of there and it was such an ordeal for us. But even though it's kinda sad, we also learned a lot about each other and how important our relationships are.\n",

      "A: Yeah, that sounds like a pretty tough situation. And I can imagine how stressful it must have been for your mom as well. But I guess they both learned to be more patient with each other. What's the funniest thing that ever happened to you while working at the dental practice?\n",
      "\n",
      "Y: Well, there was one time when my coworker had a slip of the tongue and said something really bad about our boss. So we were on duty for an hour straight just waiting for him to finish up. It turned out he wasn't going to be done until like 10pm, so we waited in there for another two hours without a break. We had no food or water, and we were sweating buckets and it was already getting dark outside. But we finally left after getting some food and water from the office. It was pretty crazy and stressful, but in a way that made us all feel like we were a team working towards our goal.\n",

      "A: Wow, I can imagine how exhausting that must have been for everyone involved! So, do you think you'll be able to save up enough money by the time your vacation comes around?\u001b[0m\n"
